# WeekOneMVPPlan_ModularApproach.md

## Overview
This plan outlines a minimal viable product (MVP) for a Week 1 CRM system, focusing on **4–5 core modules** and **best practices** for developing them individually and integrating later.

---

## Core Modules for the MVP

1. **Database + Models**  
   - **What It Does**: Defines your `tickets` table (and any supporting tables like `users`).  
   - **Key Responsibilities**:  
     - Manages all schema definitions, migrations, and CRUD operations.  
     - Serves as the single source of truth for ticket and user data.  

2. **Authentication / User Management**  
   - **What It Does**: Handles sign-up, login, roles/permissions (customers, agents, admins).  
   - **Key Responsibilities**:  
     - Verifies user identity and role-based access.  
     - Ensures only correct users can view/update specific tickets.

3. **Ticket Creation & Customer Interface**  
   - **What It Does**: Allows customers to create and view their own tickets.  
   - **Key Responsibilities**:  
     - Provides a simple form for ticket creation.  
     - Displays “My Tickets” with statuses and agent responses.

4. **Agent/Employee Interface**  
   - **What It Does**: Enables agents to see, filter, and manage tickets.  
   - **Key Responsibilities**:  
     - List and filter tickets by status, priority, etc.  
     - Update ticket status, add internal notes, communicate with the customer.

5. **(Optional) Admin Interface**  
   - **What It Does**: Offers higher-level controls if you want separation from the agent interface.  
   - **Key Responsibilities**:  
     - Manages user roles, teams, coverage schedules, and custom fields.  
     - Oversees global settings like priority definitions or custom routing rules.  

> For a true MVP, you can merge the admin interface into the agent interface if you prefer, relying on role checks (e.g., `role === 'admin'`).

## Recommended Development Approach

### 1. Define Clear Interfaces
- **Contracts**: Each module should expose a predictable input-output behavior (e.g., how data is requested or updated).  
- **APIs or Functions**: Clearly document each endpoint or function signature, making integration smoother later.

### 2. Keep a Consistent Data Model
- **Single Source of Truth**: Rely on one database schema for tickets, users, etc.  
- **Shared Schema Definitions**: If you’re using Supabase, make sure every module refers to the same generated types or definitions.

### 3. Integrate Early (But Minimally)
- **Hello World Flows**: Once each module can do the basics, try a quick “happy path” run (e.g., create a ticket in the customer module, retrieve it in the agent module) to catch major mismatches early.  
- **Incremental Merging**: Don’t wait until the very end; do partial integrations so you can fix issues as you go.

### 4. Use Stubs or Mocks
- **Parallel Development**: If one module is behind schedule, create a mock version so the other modules can continue without being blocked.  
- **Integration Layer**: For example, if the Auth module isn’t ready, mock a function that returns a user role so Ticket Creation can proceed.

### 5. Plan for Testing
- **Unit Tests Per Module**: Test each module’s business logic in isolation (e.g., database queries, ticket creation rules).  
- **Integration Tests**: Once modules are stitched together, run end-to-end tests to ensure the entire flow (customer ticket creation → agent response → status update) works.  
- **Edge Cases**: For instance, confirm an agent can’t see another team’s internal notes, or a customer can’t view a ticket that isn’t theirs.

## Putting It All Together

1. **MVP Goal**:  
   - By the end of Week 1, have a functioning CRM where:  
     1. Customers can create tickets and see their statuses.  
     2. Agents can view, respond to, and close tickets.  
     3. (Optionally) Admins can perform higher-level management tasks.

2. **Timeline**:  
   - **Days 1–2**: Database, Auth, and basic Ticket structure.  
   - **Days 3–4**: Customer and Agent interfaces (with stubs or minimal integration).  
   - **Day 5**: Merge and test everything; fix critical bugs before milestone delivery.

3. **Next Steps**:  
   - Once the MVP is stable, move into Week 2’s AI features (LLM-based auto-responses, routing, RAG knowledge base, etc.).

## Conclusion
By structuring your MVP into these core modules and following best practices for isolation, integration, and testing, you’ll set a solid foundation for your CRM. From there, layering on AI capabilities will be smoother and less error-prone, ensuring you can meet the Week 2 objectives without having to refactor the entire Week 1 codebase.
