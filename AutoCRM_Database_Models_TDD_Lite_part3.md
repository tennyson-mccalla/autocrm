## 11. Refactor and Add Additional Fields or Tables

1. **Check the Doc for More Fields**  
   - “Custom fields,” “tags,” or “internal notes” might be next.  
   - For instance, add a `tags TEXT[]` column or a `ticket_messages` table.

2. **Write a Failing Test First**  
   - e.g., “it should store tags on a ticket,” then implement that logic.

3. **Rinse & Repeat**  
   - Each new column or table → add test → implement → pass → refactor.

**Verification**:  
- You can see new columns or tables in Supabase.  
- Tests for those new features pass as well.

## 12. Basic Integration Check with Amplify (Optional Preview)

*(Not a full step of TDD for the DB, but ensures future deployment is smooth.)*

1. **Create a Basic Frontend** (just a placeholder)  
   - Could be a React app or Next.js that calls your API or directly uses Supabase client for ticket creation.

2. **Initialize Amplify for Deployment**  
   - Go to AWS Amplify console, connect your GitHub repo.  
   - Amplify will build your project automatically on pushes (though you may only have a minimal front-end right now).

3. **Confirm a Deployed URL**  
   - It might just show a placeholder page, but you’ll see that Amplify is set up and can deploy changes.

**Verification**:  
- Amplify shows “Build Succeeded” or similar on each commit to the main branch.  
- You have a URL to share, even if it’s not fully functional yet.

---

## 13. Document and Wrap Up

1. **Add a Short README** or doc note (e.g., `docs/DatabaseModule.md`)  
   - Summarize how the Database + Models module is structured, how to run tests, how to run migrations.

2. **Create Issues or To-Dos for Next Steps**  
   - E.g., “Implement internal notes,” “Add multiple user roles,” “Integrate AI in Week 2,” etc.

3. **Push Everything to GitHub**  
   - Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`.

**Verification**:  
- A new dev can clone the repo, run migrations, and test the Database + Models module using the instructions in your README.  
- You see the final commit on GitHub with a description of what’s done.

## Final Remarks

- **This ultra-atomic breakdown** ensures a junior dev knows exactly what to do at each stage.  
- By following these steps, you’ll have **ticket filing** (create/read/update/delete) in a Supabase database and a minimal testing setup, which **fulfills the core Database + Models requirement** for your **AutoCRM** Week 1 MVP.  
- Remember, additional features (tags, internal notes, etc.) can be layered in using the same TDD-lite approach.  
- Once the back end is stable, you can move on to the other modules (auth, customer/agent UI, etc.) and eventually integrate AI features in Week 2.
